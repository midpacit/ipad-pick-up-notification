Greetings Mid-Pacific parents and guardians of <<First Name>> <<Last Name>>,

We are writing to let you know that students in <strong>grades 6 through 12 taking Summer Programs at Mid-Pacific </strong> can schedule a date to pick-up the Mid-Pacific iPad. Students in elementary school and those that are not enrolled in summer programs will receive a notification for iPad pick up after summer programs at a later date. In order to ensure a smooth and efficient process, we ask that you carefully read through the following information and follow the three steps below:

<strong>1. Purchase an iPad Case</strong>
All students are required to have an iPad case before picking up their new iPad. Please review the <a href="http://tech.midpac.edu/aup/2024/case.pdf">case specifications and guidelines document</a> and purchase a case that matches the level of protection you think the iPad will require. 
	
For families that may not have a case at pick-up time due to shipping delays, you may still come to pick up the iPad, but it will be your responsibility to keep it safe until a case arrives.

<strong>2. <a href="https://calendar.app.google/tK3JhrBRppxDpdMg6">Schedule a Date to Pick up the iPad</strong></a>
Schedule a date and time to pick up the iPad <a href="https://calendar.app.google/tK3JhrBRppxDpdMg6"><strong>using this link</strong></a>. You will need your child's Student ID to schedule an appointment. Their Student ID is: <<ID>>. This is also located under the barcode on the PDF attached to this email. <strong>iPad pick up will be on weekdays from May 29 through June 4th from 8am - 10am and 1pm - 3pm.</strong> 

<em>If you are unable to find a pick up time that works with your schedule, simply reply to this email to make alternative plans.</em>

When you arrive on campus, tell the front gate security station that you are here to pick up the iPad. They will direct you where to park and how to get to the IT offices. 

The IT office is located in the Kawaiaha'o building, on the bottom floor, across from the library. Signs will be posted. 

<strong>3. Present the PDF that is attached to this email when picking up the iPad</strong>
You will not be able to pick up the iPad without it. The PDF contains a barcode with your child's student ID, which you will need to display at the time of pick-up. Print it out or present it on your phone at the time of pickup.
