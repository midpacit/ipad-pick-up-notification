Greetings Mid-Pacific parents and guardians of <<First Name>> <<Last Name>>,

Students in <strong>grades 6–12 enrolled in Mid-Pacific Summer Programs</strong> may now schedule a date to pick up their Mid-Pacific iPad.  

Students in elementary school or not enrolled in summer programs will receive a separate iPad pick-up notice after summer ends.

To ensure a smooth and efficient process, please carefully read the information below and follow these three steps:

<strong>1. Purchase an iPad Case</strong>
All students are required to have an iPad case before picking up their device. Please review the <a href="http://tech.midpac.edu/aup/2024/case.pdf">case specifications and guidelines</a> and purchase a case that provides the appropriate level of protection for your child’s needs.

If your case has not yet arrived due to shipping delays, you may still come to pick up the iPad—but you'll be responsible for keeping it safe until the case arrives.

<strong>2. <a href="https://calendar.app.google/tK3JhrBRppxDpdMg6">Schedule a Date to Pick up the iPad (LINK)</strong></a>
Use the link above to select a date and time. You will need your child’s Student ID to book an appointment. Their Student ID is: <strong><<ID>></strong>. This is also printed under the barcode on the attached PDF.

<strong>Pick-up Dates & Times:</strong>  
Weekdays from <strong>May 29 through June 4</strong>  
Available time slots: <strong>8:00 AM–10:00 AM</strong> and <strong>1:00 PM–3:00 PM</strong>  

<em>If you're unable to find a time that works for you, simply reply to this email to make alternative arrangements.</em>

When you arrive on campus, let the front gate security staff know you're here to pick up the iPad. They will direct you where to park and how to reach the IT office.

The IT office is located on the bottom floor of the Kawaiaha‘o building, directly across from the library. Signs will be posted.

<strong>3. Present the PDF that is attached to this email when picking up the iPad</strong>
The iPad cannot be issued without the attached PDF. It contains a barcode with your child’s Student ID, which must be shown at the time of pick-up. You may print it or display it on your phone.
